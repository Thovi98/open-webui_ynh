Important Note on User Roles and Privacy:

- Admin Creation: The first account created on Open WebUI gains Administrator privileges, controlling user management and system settings.
- User Registrations: Subsequent sign-ups start with Pending status, requiring Administrator approval for access.
- Privacy and Data Security: All your data, including login details, is locally stored on your device. Open WebUI ensures strict confidentiality and no external requests for enhanced privacy and security.
    All models are private by default. Models must be explicitly shared via groups or by being made public. If a model is assigned to a group, only members of that group can see it. If a model is made public, anyone on the instance can see it.
